How to improve delivery of project info:
- make it less resume-ish, more interactive. Right now just a fancy presentation.
- Idea 1: Have each project be a destination on a rail map. There is a user-train which travels the network between nodes when resume simulation is pressed.
Then, a set of switches controls the track formation, allowing the user to control the network state to arrive at a specific project-station. A view of the current location (project) is available to the user.
- Idea 2 [Extension of Idea 1]: Have less switch controllers than there are switches. The network is now a puzzle where each switch controls one or more junctions. The user must find the correct switch controller arangement to have the network connect the user-train to the right station-project.
